    <h1>Ingridents</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp rasisins</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, cut into eighths</li>
      <li>1 cup walnuts</li>
      <li>⅓ cup dried prunes, choppped</li>
      <li>2 tbsp ghee</li>
      <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
      <li>½ tsp pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>⅔ cup plum preserves or plum jam</li>
      <li>3 large chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the raisins in room temperature water for 30 minutes. In a separate
        bowl, also soak the prunes for 30 minutes in room temperature water.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
      <li>
        Clean the chicken breasts. Using a knife, cut a slit horizontally down
        the fatter side edge of the chicken breast. Make sure to not cut the
        slit so deep that the knife comes out of the other side of the chicken.
        You are making a pocket to store the filling inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the slits are cut in the chicken, use your hands to massage the
        plum preserves into the raw chicken. Season chicken on both sides using
        pepper, garlic powder, and light salt.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Makign the filling</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Blend the onion quarters in a blender until a liquid forms.</li>
      <li>
        Line a medium mixing bowl with a dish towel and pour the blended onion
        into the dish towel. Wrap the dish towel up, and squeeze out all of the
        excess water from the blended onion. Dispose of the liquid. The
        remaining onion should stick together like dry sand when squeezed in
        your palm. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Blend the walnuts in the blender. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Strain the water from the prunes and put the hydrated prunes in the
        blender. Blend and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a wooden spoon, combine the blended onions, walnuts, and prunes in
        a mixing bowl. Drain the raisins and mix into the filling. Season with
        salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Melt the ghee and pour into the mixture
        as well. Mix to combine. The filling should be wet but not runny.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Assembly and Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill each chicken breast with the filling. Lay the chicken breasts on an
        aluminum-lined cookie sheet and place in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast for about 45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads the
        internal temperature as 165 degrees. Enjoy!
